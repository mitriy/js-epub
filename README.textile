h2. A note on XMLHttpRequest

There have been numerous reports of problems with JSEpub when XMLHttpRequst/XHR/AJAX have been used to download EPUBs.

The problem is encoding related. The easiest way to get around it, given browsers are harsh environments, is to Base64 encode the epub on the server, and Base64 decode it again on the client.

<pre><code>// Server side, here with Ruby. The approach applies to any language.
def serve_epub
  @response.body << Base64.encode64(File.read("/path/to/my.epub"))
end

// Client side
jQuery.get("/epubs/dynamic/my.epub", function (data) {
    var decodedData = someBase64DecoderHere(data); // Find a base64 decoder on google or whatever. 
    new JSEpub(decodedData);
});
</code></pre>

h2. Usage

see demo.html

The library is pretty low level, to give you all the flexibility you need when you handle your EPUBs.

h2. Installing and using

JSEpub has the following dependencies:

* "zip.js":https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js. EPUB files are packaged as a Zip
  archive.

Include these scripts on your page before you include js-epub. They don't require any configuration or initialization.
